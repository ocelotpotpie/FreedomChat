# Whether FreedomChat should claim to clients that secure chat is enforced.
# With this set to true, the "Chat messages can't be verified" toast will not

# That being said, you may still see the toast even if this option is enabled.
# Note that enabling this option may violate Minecraft's usage guidelines.
